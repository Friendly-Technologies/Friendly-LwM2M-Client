## Introduction

Friendly LwM2M Client is an open-source Lightweight machine-to-machine (LwM2M) client implementation designed for IoT devices. LwM2M is a protocol specified by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) for remote device management and service enablement for M2M and IoT devices and systems, intended for both resource-constrained and high-performance edge devices.

## Getting Started 
This section provides instructions on how to build and run the Friendly LwM2M client. Also, this section will describe the environment requirements, and the setup process for the build, and explain the two methods for building and running the Friendly LwM2M client.
The Friendly LwM2M client can be built and run in two different ways: using VS Code and using the command line.
The method using VS Code is suitable for developing and modifying example parameters, while the command line is suitable for quick building and exploring the capabilities.

Before proceeding with the description, it should also be noted that this guide will cover running an example that demonstrates the Friendly LwM2M client functionality. The client itself is provided as a library that can be built separately.

### Prerequisites

- OS Ubuntu 22.04
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.10 or higher
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) for DTLS support
- C/C++ compiler (clang-14, clang++-14)

### Setup build environment

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Friendly-Technologies/Friendly-LwM2M-Client.git
    cd Friendly-LwM2M-Client
    ```

2. Setup environment:
    ```sh
    sh ./wpp_env_setup.sh
    ```

During step **2**, documentation will also be automatically generated and launched in the browser, so for more information on the structure and usage of the Friendly LwM2M client, you can refer to it.

After successfully completing these steps, we will have a fully configured environment with the loaded source files. The next steps are to build the example and run it. As mentioned earlier, this can be done using one of the two methods: via VS Code or the command line. Each method will be detailed further.

### Command line

1. Create build directory:
    ```sh
    mkdir _build
    cd _build
    ```

2. Generate build scripts with CMake:
    ```sh
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++
    ```

3. Building:
    ```sh
    cmake --build . --config MinSizeRel --target WppExample -j 14 --
    ```

4. Running:
    ```sh
    cd examples
    ./WppExample
    ```

### VS Code

1. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Start VS Code and open workspace which is set up for this project `File → Open Workspace` from File.
3. In the open window, specify the path to the file `vs-code-wpp.code-workspace` located in the `Friendly-LwM2M-Client` repository.
4. After the workspace has loaded, go to `Extensions` (Ctrl+Shift+x), set `Recommended` (Text field: @recommended) in the extensions filter, and then install all recommended extensions.
5. Let’s move on to the `CMake Tool` extension, the open one contains the entire main interface.
6. Setup `Kit` for `Friendly-LwM2M-Client` project, to do this in the `Configure` section select `Wpp Linux Kit`.
7. Setup `Build Target`, to do this in the `Build` section select `WppExample`.
8. Press `Build` button
9. Launch the client, to do this in the `Launch` section select `WppExample`, and press `Run in Terminal` button.

### Configuration

The generated client example is configured using the source file: `Friendly-LwM2M-Client/examples/objects.cpp`. After changing the configuration, the client example should be built again.

By default, `WppExample` has the following configurations:
1. COAP server: coaps://demodm.friendly-tech.com:5684.
2. DTLS enabled.
3. Data formats: CBOR, SENML CBOR, SENML JSON, JSON, TLV.
4. Objects: DEVICE, LWM2M SERVER, LWM2M SECURITY, CONNECTIVITY MONITORING, LWM2M ACCESS CONTROL, FIRMWARE UPDATE.
