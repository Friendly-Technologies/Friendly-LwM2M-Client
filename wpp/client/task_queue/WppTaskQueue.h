/**
 * @class WppTaskQueue
 * @brief Represents a task queue for Wakaama Plus.
 * 
 * The queue of tasks does not guarantee timely calling of a task
 * with a fixed delay, all tasks in the queue are processed sequentially,
 * it is only guaranteed that the task will be called after the specified
 * delay. The queue should not be used for critical tasks. When a task is
 * created via addTask(), the party that creates the task must guarantee
 * the validity of the ctx_t ctx during the entire existence of the 
 * task. Tasks may be deleted not immediately, but with the next call to
 * handleEachTask(), but it is guaranteed that the deleted task will not
 * be executed. It is forbidden to use any delays in the task, because all
 * the tasks are executed sequentially in the same thread, this will cause
 * an execution delay for other tasks. WppTaskQueue should be used only for
 * tasks that require the WppClient context.
 * 
 * The implementation is completely thread-safe and allows calling its methods
 * from tasks.
 * 
 * @note The WppTaskQueue class is a singleton.
