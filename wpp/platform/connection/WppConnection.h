/**
 * @brief The WppConnection class represents a connection interface for the Wakaama Plus library.
 * 
 * This class provides an abstract interface for establishing and managing connections in the Wakaama Plus library.
 * It defines pure virtual methods that must be implemented by the user to establish a connection, disconnect from a connection,
 * compare session identifiers, and send packets over the connection.
 * 
 * The WppConnection class also provides methods for adding packets to a queue, retrieving the size of the packet queue,
 * clearing the packet queue, and setting/getting the COAP block size.
 * 
 * @note This class is meant to be subclassed by the user to provide the implementation for the virtual methods.
