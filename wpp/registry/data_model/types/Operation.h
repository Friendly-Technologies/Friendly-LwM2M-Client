 * @brief The Operation struct represents the operations that can be performed on a instance/resource.
 * 
 * This struct defines a set of operations that can be performed on a instance/resource. Each operation is represented
 * by a flag value, which can be combined using bitwise OR to represent multiple operations.
 * 
 * The Operation struct provides methods to check if a specific operation is supported, check compatibility
 * with another Operation object, and retrieve the flags representing the operations.
 * 
 * The Operation struct also provides methods to check if an operation is of a specific type, such as read, write,
 * execute, discover, delete or create.
 * 
 * Additionally, the Operation struct provides a method to convert the flags into a vector of operation types.
